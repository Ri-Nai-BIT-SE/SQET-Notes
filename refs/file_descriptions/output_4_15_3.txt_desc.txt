This file is a transcription of a university lecture on software quality and testing. The lecture covers several key topics:

1.  **White-Box Testing Recap**: The lecture begins by reviewing previous topics, including logical coverage criteria (statement, decision, condition coverage) and the importance of using control flow graphs for analysis.

2.  **Basic Path Testing**: This is the main technical focus. It is presented as a crucial and frequently examined topic. The key concepts discussed are:
    *   **Objective**: To reduce the infinite number of possible test paths to a manageable, fundamental set.
    *   **Independent Paths**: A path that introduces at least one new edge not covered by other independent paths.
    *   **Cyclomatic Complexity (VG)**: A quantitative measure of the logical complexity of a program. The lecture emphasizes that the value of VG directly determines the number of independent paths needed for a complete basis set.
    *   **Methodology**: The prescribed four-step process is:
        1.  Draw the program's control flow graph from its source code.
        2.  Calculate the cyclomatic complexity (VG).
        3.  Identify the set of basic independent paths.
        4.  Design test cases to execute each path in the basis set.

3.  **Other Testing Types**: The lecture provides an overview of various applied testing techniques, including:
    *   **Compatibility Testing**: Ensuring the software works across different hardware, operating systems, browsers, and databases.
    *   **Usability Testing**: Assessing how easy the software is to understand, learn, and use. It cautions against making this purely subjective.
    *   **Reliability Testing**: Measuring the software's ability to perform its function under given conditions for a specified period.
    *   **Documentation Testing**: Verifying the accuracy and clarity of user manuals, help files, and other associated documents.
    *   **Load and Stress Testing**: A major topic, often tested with analysis questions. It involves testing system performance under high concurrency and finding the system's breaking point.

4.  **Course and Project Administration**: A significant portion of the lecture is dedicated to logistical matters, including:
    *   Detailed instructions for the final project presentation and defense (`答辩`), covering timing, grading, peer review, and individual questioning.
    *   Guidance on the final project report, explaining how students can earn extra credit by implementing and documenting tests beyond the basic requirements, such as compatibility or performance testing.
    *   Announcements about signing up for student-led presentations on testing tools.
