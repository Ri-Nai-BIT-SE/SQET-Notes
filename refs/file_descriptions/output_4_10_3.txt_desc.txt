This file contains a detailed transcript of a classroom discussion about software testing plans for student projects, primarily a "Master Puzzle" game developed with Python and Pygame. The discussion involves a student presenter (Jingyin, likely from the first group), other student groups (Fifth Group, Seventh Group), and the teacher (Jiang Laoshi).

**Part 1: First Group's Presentation Summary (Jingyin)**

The first group presents their software testing plan for the "Master Puzzle" game.

*   **Project Overview:** A puzzle game developed in Python/Pygame, featuring rectangular/triangular puzzles, multiple difficulty levels, custom image import, save/load functionality, and leaderboards.
*   **Testing Goals:** To ensure comprehensive quality verification, confirm compliance with requirements, validate functionality, assess usability, monitor performance, and diligently track and resolve defects.
*   **Testing Scope:**
    *   **Functional Testing:** Covers user management (registration, login, password validation), data management (save, load, delete, integrity, boundary conditions), custom features (image import, custom rows/columns), leaderboard (score recording, display, clear), core game functions (puzzle generation, interaction, completion detection), auxiliary functions (undo, redo, mute), and game settings (difficulty, puzzle type).
    *   **Usability Testing:** Focuses on UI design (color scheme, button layout, visual consistency), operation flow (smoothness from launch to exit), interaction experience (mouse/keyboard response, error clarity, fault tolerance), and information display (timer, step count, difficulty readability, reference image utility).
    *   **Documentation Checks:** Reviews requirements and design documents for completeness, accuracy, consistency, and modularity. Excludes third-party library defects, out-of-scope features, and external adaptation tests.
*   **Testing Resources:**
    *   **Team:** Five members with roles including test lead, test engineers, documentation specialist, and development liaison.
    *   **Environment:** Same as the development environment, with an independent test directory to avoid conflicts.
    *   **Tools (Tentative):** Static testing (CHECKLI for documents, FP Fa for code), dynamic testing (option management, collaboration, performance monitoring tools), and auxiliary tools for test case management. Tool selection may be adjusted.
*   **Testing Strategy & Methods:** Employs a strategy of static testing first, dynamic testing throughout, and supplementary specialized testing.
    *   **Static Testing:** Document review (completeness, consistency, accuracy) and code review (coding standards, logic, static issues).
    *   **Dynamic Testing (Black-box focused):** Functional testing with layered test cases (normal, abnormal, boundary conditions); Usability testing (UI layout, response, feedback, error messages); Performance testing (load time, stability over 1 hour, response time for key operations).
    *   **Documentation Check:** Assesses completeness, organization, consistency, and readability of test documents.
*   **Test Standards:** Defines specific pass/fail criteria for functional (e.g., no critical defects, <5 minor defects), usability (e.g., UI layout conformity, 3-minute game flow, clear error messages), and documentation (e.g., no missing docs, consistent descriptions, accurate parameters, utility for test case design).
*   **Test Work Arrangement:** Divided into six phases: Preparation, Static Testing, Dynamic Testing, Defect Repair Confirmation, and Summary.
*   **Risk Assessment & Response:** Identifies and plans responses for requirement risks (vague descriptions), environment risks (version inconsistency), test coverage risks (core algorithms), and schedule risks (long defect repair cycles).
*   **Expected Deliverables:** Test plan, test case set, test results, summary report, defect tracking records, and midterm submission documents.

**Part 2: Teacher's Feedback and General Discussion**

The teacher, Jiang Laoshi, provides extensive feedback, often comparing the presentations and highlighting common issues or best practices.

*   **Project Context (Elementary School Project):** A recurring theme is that all presented projects were originally "elementary school projects" (小學期 - a smaller, semester-long project), implying prior development and possibly prior, less formal testing. The teacher emphasizes the need for groups to clearly articulate how the current testing (for *this* course) builds upon or re-evaluates previous work, rather than just re-submitting old work.
    *   **Key Concern:** Ensure the students are applying new knowledge from the testing course and genuinely performing new testing activities.
    *   **Suggestions:** Explicitly state if previous test cases are being reused, reviewed, or if new ones are created based on course learning. Explain the "why" of a second testing round (e.g., applying formal methods, fixing known issues, adding new features).
*   **Presenter 1 Specific Feedback:**
    *   **Clarity on Prior Testing:** Jingyin should clarify that the "Master Puzzle" project had prior informal testing, and how the current formal plan incorporates or extends that.
    *   **Personnel:** For final defense, use specific names for roles, not just "two people," "one person."
    *   **Schedule:** Avoid vague "three days, five days" for project scheduling; use tools like Gantt charts to show parallel/sequential tasks and dependencies.
    *   **Grading Alignment:** Structure the presentation to explicitly hit the teacher's grading criteria (e.g., functional, usability, documentation as core, performance as bonus), showing how static and dynamic testing methods are applied to each.
    *   **Documentation Basis:** Clarify which document (requirements, design, or product manual) serves as the primary basis for black-box test case design, linking to the V-model concept.
*   **Presenter 2 Specific Feedback (Fifth Group):**
    *   **Known Defects:** The group mentioned the project had issues like crashes when initially submitted. The teacher stresses that explicitly fixing these known bugs and performing regression testing *is* a valid and important part of the current course work, demonstrating real-world testing practices.
    *   **Testing Phases (Unit, Integration, System):** Questions how these phases apply to an already-existing system, unless new features are being added (which the group confirms is their plan for new functionality).
*   **Presenter 3 Specific Feedback (Seventh Group):**
    *   **Defect Classification:** This group introduced a system for classifying defects by severity, which the teacher notes as a valuable "basic work" missing from other presentations.
    *   **Iterative Development:** The group plans to add new modules and perform unit/integration testing specifically on these new features, which addresses the teacher's concern about applying testing phases to an existing system.
*   **General Class-wide Instructions:**
    *   **References:** Always cite reference documents and standards used.
    *   **Workload Metrics:** Emphasize tracking workload by metrics like number of test cases designed/executed, pass rates, and execution rates for quality reports.
    *   **Project Management (Shared Excel Document):** The teacher expresses strong dissatisfaction with the class's failure to properly fill out a shared Excel document for team information (names, project details). This document is crucial for decision-making (e.g., assigning TAs).
        *   **Action:** The shared Excel document will be reopened. All groups *must* update it to ensure consistency between their presentation and the document, and to fill in all required fields.
    *   **Risk Management:** Reminds students to build buffer time into schedules to account for unforeseen issues or delays, rather than planning right up to the deadline.
    *   **Deliverables:** The PPT is for presentation, but the final Word document for the test plan is the actual, detailed deliverable.
    *   **Course Focus:** Students should focus on the *extension* of their projects with course concepts, adopting a "testing mindset," rather than just rehashing past work.
